Application of Clustering and Time Series Visualization -
This was a class project in Engineering Analytics- 1 class. The idea of project was to form 4 clusters companies based on different financial parmeters. Then rank every cluster based in the positive and negative of that financial parameter. Finally add all the ranks to find growth index of company. we have used Gross Margin, Operating margin, Pre-tax ROE ,and Profit margins parameters from fundmentals dataset.After that based on the historical data points I checked 90 days forcasting.
